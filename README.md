# Django Instant Rest

The fastest production-ready REST tool for Python + Django! It allows you to quickly build RESTful APIs based on [Django Models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/). Although not as configurable as [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) Django Instant Rest provides a fully featured API with enterprise-grade filtering and pagination in only a handful of lines.
